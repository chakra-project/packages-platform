<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Profiles</h2>

<p>This feature of the <em>larch</em> build system allows bundling
all the configuration information for a particular live CD 'design' into
a single directory. That includes the list of packages to be installed, locale
information and the particular tweaks and additions needed to customize the CD,
in particular a subdirectory containing the 'overlay' files - those files
which have been changed from their initial fresh state after installation
and those which have simply been added.
</p>

<p>A profile is a directory, the name of the profile is the directory's
name. The simplest feature is perhaps the 'rootoverlay' subdirectory:
everything in this directory is copied directly to the <em>live</em>
system's overlay, so that the a file 'a/b/c' within this directory will
appear at '/a/b/c' in the <em>live</em> system, regardless of whether this
file previously existed. Note however that all ownerships are changed to
'root:root'.
</p>

<p>If you would like to have a look at a profile, look in the 'profiles'
directory in the distribution. Each of its subdirectories is a profile.
If you want to make your own profile, it is probably easiest to start with
one of the examples. The <em>larch</em> gui allows you to copy one of these
into your working directory, and rename it.
</p>

<p>The main files within a profile are described below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>addedpacks</strong> - a simple list of packages (just package
  name as supplied to 'pacman -S', e.g. 'syslinux', not the file name), one
  per line, comment lines start with '#'.
  This is the primary place for configuring which packages are installed.
  Also package groups may occur here (e.g. 'xorg'), and if these are
  preceded by a '*' their constituent packages will be filtered by the
  veto list in <em>vetopacks</em>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>vetopacks</strong> - This file is optional. It provides a list of
  packages (one package per line) to be ignored when installing from package
  groups (e.g. 'base' or 'xorg'). Note that only packages which are not
  required by others can actually be prevented from being installed, and that
  only packages in 'base' and in those groups in <em>addedpacks</em> which
  are preceded by a '*' will be omitted from the installation list.
  </li>

  <li><strong>bootlines</strong> - This file contains bootloader independent
  boot lines, so that the same file can be used for grub and isolinux/syslinux.
  The gui provides a button to edit this file.
  To get an idea of what should be in here look at the default version (in
  the 'larch' package, 'cd-root' directory), or just click on the button.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rootoverlay</strong> (directory) - The files in this directory
  are effectively copied on top of the original system - as an overlay.
  They (potentially) form the bulk of the customization for the live system.
  This directory is optional, but editing any of the files mentioned below
  via the gui will create it automatically.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rootoverlay/etc/rc.conf</strong> - As a major point of
  configuration in an <em>Arch</em> system this is important enough
  to get a button in the <em>larch</em> gui to edit it.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rootoverlay/etc/locale.gen</strong> - For convenience, the
  <em>larch</em> gui provides a button to edit this file, which determines
  which glibc locales are supported in the <em>live</em> system.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rootoverlay/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.larch0</strong> - Again for
  convenience, the <em>larch</em> gui provides a button to edit this file,
  which allows you to tweak the initramfs. This is a special version of
  '/etc/mkinitcpio.conf' which is used to generate the initramfs for the
  <em>larch live</em> system. The default version is supplied as
  '/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.larch0' in the 'larch-live' package. Whatever else
  you change, don't change the larch hooks.
  </li>

  <li><strong>rootoverlay/etc/inittab.larch</strong> - If this file is
  present it will cause the original /etc/inittab to be saved with a
  '.larchsave' suffix, and this new version will be used for the
  <em>live</em> 'inittab'. This allows a special version of this file to
  be used just for the <em>live</em> system, an installer
  can replace it by the original during the installation process.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root</strong> (directory) - This directory contains files
  that will be (more or less) directly copied to the <em>larch</em> medium,
  partly dependent on the chosen bootloader.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/isolinux0</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the isolinux (syslinux) directory of the medium
  if the isolinux (syslinux) bootloader is chosen. If this directory doesn't
  exist, the default version from the 'larch' package, 'cd-root' directory,
  will be taken.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/isolinux</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the isolinux (syslinux) directory of the medium
  if the isolinux (syslinux) bootloader is chosen. It can be used to overwrite
  or add to the files in the previously copied 'isolinux0' directory.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/grub0</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the boot directory of the medium
  if the grub bootloader is chosen. If this directory doesn't
  exist, the default version from the 'larch' package, 'cd-root' directory,
  will be taken.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/grub</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the boot directory of the medium
  if the grub bootloader is chosen. It can be used to overwrite
  or add to the files in the previously copied 'grub0' directory.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/boot0</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the isolinux/syslinux/boot directory of the
  medium after the bootloader specific stuff is copied. If this directory
  doesn't exist, the default version from the 'larch' package, 'cd-root'
  directory, will be taken.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/boot</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will be copied to the isolinux/syslinux/boot directory of the
  medium after the bootloader specific stuff is copied. It can be used to
  overwrite or add to the files in the previously copied
  'grub0'/'isolinux0'/'boot' directory.
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/larch/copy</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will appear in '/larch/copy' on the medium and during booting
  the <em>larch live</em> system will copy the contents of this directory
  to the <em>tmpfs</em> base directory ('/.livesys').
  </li>

  <li><strong>cd-root/larch/extra</strong> (directory) - The contents of this
  directory will appear in '/larch/extra' on the medium but are otherwise
  unconnected with any <em>larch</em>  functionality.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Further files which may be found within a profile are described below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>users</strong> - It is possible to add user accounts to the
  system during building. See below.
  </li>

  <li><strong>skel_*</strong> (directory) - Customized '/etc/skel' substitutes
  for use at build time only. See below.
  </li>

  <li><strong>vetodirs</strong> - Do not use this unless you really know what
  you are doing. Each directory listed in this file (one entry per line,
  comment lines start with '#') will be excluded from the live system. The
  directories are relative to the installation root.
  </li>

  <li><strong>build-tweak</strong> - Do not use this unless you really know
  what you are doing. It is a program (script) - so it must be executable -
  to customize the construction of the overlay (to a certain extent). It gets
  two arguments on the command line: the path to the installation being
  larchified, and the (full) path to the directory in which the overlay is
  being constructed. It is called just before 'mods.sqf' is squashed, but
  also before users are added.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding user accounts</h3>

<p>
The construction details should be provided in the 'users' file in the
profile directory. It is an 'ini'-style configuration file, the sections
being the user names. Here is an example:
<pre>[DEFAULT]
pw =
expert =
skel =
maingroup =
uid =
xgroups = video,audio,optical,storage,scanner,power,camera

[u1]
uid = 999
skel =

[u2]
pw = p1
expert =
skel =
maingroup =
uid =
xgroups = video,audio,optical,storage
</pre>
The 'DEFAULT' section is not necessary, but is generated automatically
by the gui user-table editor. Only entries which differ from the default
values need be present.
</p>
<p>The default primary group is defined by settings in '/etc/login.defs'
and '/etc/default/useradd' ('USERGROUPS_ENAB yes' in 'etc/login.defs'
causes this to be a group with the same name as the user). You can
override this by adding an 'expert' option, or by placing modified versions
of these files in the profile's 'rootoverlay' directory.
</p>
<p>The additional groups should be comma-separated and without spaces.
</p>
<p>If no 'skel'-file is specified, the default ('/etc/skel') is used, including
anything in the overlay. To use a custom 'skel'-file, place the directory
in the profile, giving it a name starting with 'skel_', and place the rest of
the name (the part after '_') in the configuration line.
</p>
<p>A password can be set for the new user by entering this (plain text -
I'm guessing this is alright in this situation ...). An empty password
field will allow passwordless logins (at least on the console).
</p>
<p>By default the UID number will be chosen automatically, but a specific
number may be entered here. In <em>Arch Linux</em> the UIDs normally start
at 1000.
</p>
<p>Users are added by means of 'useradd', so anything placed in the 'expert'
field should be a valid option to that command. If a user-name already exists
in the system to be larchified, it will be ignored (it does not count as
an error).
</p>

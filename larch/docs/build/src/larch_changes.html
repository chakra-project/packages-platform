<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Changes from <em>larch</em>-5</h2>

<p>The most obvious change is that there is a graphical user interface. I am not
really sure myself whether this is a good idea or not, but it's there and I had an
interesting time producing the mountain of code behind it. I suppose it's all rather
anti-KISS in the end (don't ask me how many different threads and processes it
starts!), but there are some advantages ...
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Most of the main options are immediately visible, you don't need to search
   for obscure command line parameters.
   </li>
   <li>The use of python rather than bash for the bulk of the code means
   that internationalization, using <em>gettext</em> is relatively easy.
   A rough German translation is in place as an example, but that's the
   limit of my linguistic flexibility!
   </li>
   <li>The front end code can run as a normal user. I don't think this significantly
   reduces the risk of your system being destroyed, but it does mean that it is easy
   to keep the configuration files with normal user ownership, while the installation
   is handled with root privileges, and not get things mixed up.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the other changes are concerned with providing new features.
***+ The extent of the changes means that it will probably take a while
until the bugs get ironed out and everything works. I am calling the
present state <strong>alpha</strong>, while a few implementation details
are still under review. I will call it <em>beta</em> and give it release
numbers starting with 7.1 when most of that is cleared up. -***
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Selection of the boot partition is now possible via UUID or label, as well as the
   previously available methods of partition (/dev/sdb1, etc.) and search for 'larchboot'
   file.
   </li>
   <li><em>larch</em> now manages all configuration files and project information
   internally. The relevant files are of course still accessible from outside of the
   <em>larch</em> program, but the need for this should be reduced. I hope this
   will help users (me!) keep their projects tidy. ***+ This is an experimental
   feature that will probably need some tweaking. -***
   </li>
   <li>Kernel update using the normal pacman commands is now supported.
   </li>
   <li>The boot entries can be provided in a bootloader neutral form, so that
   one can use the same entries with GRUB or syslinux/isolinus without having
   to keep copies for each.
   </li>
   <li>Installation to partitions, irrespective of whether they are USB-sticks or hard
   disks, is easily possible, with or without installation of a bootloader.
   </li>
   <li>I have tried to minimize the extent to which the underlying <em>Arch</em>
   system must be modified to work as a <em>live</em> system. The introduction
   of 'hooks' in the <em>Arch</em> initscripts should ease the situation quite a bit.
   </li>
   <li>Many changes to the handling of configuration files, see the relevant sections.
   </li>
   <li>The overlay structure is slightly different, an extra layer (filter.sqf) has been
   added between system.sqf and mods.sqf, with the result that mods.sqf no longer
   contains whiteouts. This approach means that overlay merging doesn't require a
   specially configured <em>aufs</em> and I hope it will turn out to be less buggy.
   </li>
   <li>Another change to the overlay structure is that initially, and after an overlay
   merge, there is no memory overlay file (now called 'overlay.tar.lzo') at all. This
   should allow easy reversion to an earlier state - deleting the overlay file will
   return the system to just after the last merge. Also previous mods.sqf and
   filter.sqf pairs could be saved to preserve still earlier states. (It is unfortunately
   not quite so simple if a kernel update has taken place, though.)
   </li>
   <li>The gui aids simple modifications to the installed <em>Arch</em> system
   via <em>pacman</em> (resynchronization, package addition and removal). This
   is not recommended as a normal procedure (the packages would no longer
   correspond to those in the profile's 'addedpacks' file), but it could be useful
   for experimentation and quick fixes.
   </li>
   <li>The 'larch-rebuild' script (in the 'larch-live' package) allows the
   overlays to be merged back into the base ('system.sqf') archive, if enough
   storage space is available. This would allow a <em>live</em> system
   which had become bloated with overlay files to be 'rejuvenated'. It
   itself is not a complete solution because it only rebuilds 'system.sqf'
   and 'mods.sqf', it can't replace the old system, but it can form the
   basis of such a scheme.
   </li>
</ul>

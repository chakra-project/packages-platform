<h3>Projects</h3>

<p><em>larch-7</em> uses 'projects' to gather together a few configuration
options concerning the build environment. Examples are the location of the
<em>Arch</em> installation to be 'larchified' (converted to a <em>live</em>
system), pacman options such as package
repository locations, which 'profile' (see below) to build with, which boot
loader to use, and so on. These are all options which don't directly affect
the essential design of the <em>live</em> system to be built. Most of the
remaining configuration options do concern the design and are specified in
the profile.
</p>

<p>All project information is kept in the simply structured configuration
file '~/.config/larch/larch-config'.
</p>

<p>A new named project can be created in the advanced options on the
Project-Settings tab of the GUI. For many purposes this will be unnecessary
and one can use the default project, 'larch0' (this is why it is among the
advanced options). It is also possible to delete projects which are no longer
needed, and to set the path of the installation to be larchified.
</p>

<h4>Installation Path</h4>

<p>The installation that <em>larch</em> turns into a <em>live</em> system
need not be on a separate partition, it can be placed anywhere convenient.
The default installation directory ('/home/larchbuild') should normally be
acceptable, so long as there is enough free space on that partition.
Note that lots of space is necessary, nearly 4GB for a 700MB CD, for example.
The <em>live</em> system is built in the '.larch' sub-directory; it must be
within the installation to be converted because some of the construction work
is done using <em>chroot</em>.
</p>

<p>The installation of the <em>Arch Linux</em> system to be larchified is
handled on the <a href="gui_installation.html">'Installation'</a> tab of
the GUI, but an already existing <em>Arch Linux</em> installation can also
be larchified: see <a href="larch_overview.html#existingSystem">
Making a live CD from an existing Arch installation</a>
</p>

<h3>Profiles</h3>

<p>A profile contains the information needed to build a particular flavour
of <em>(live) Arch Linux</em> - which packages to install, which locales,
system configuration in '/etc/rc.conf', boot entries, and so on. Apart
from a few basic configuration details (mainly those concerned specifically
with the special needs of a <em>live</em> system) for which <em>larch</em>
provides a special mechanism, all desired changes from the freshly
installed state should be placed in the directory 'rootoverlay' within
the profile directory. This allows easy rebuilding of a particularly
configured system, and it also allows various (differently configured)
<em>live</em> systems to be built from the same underlying installation,
without touching the installation itself.
</p>

<p>Profiles may be added, renamed and deleted at will, but be careful
when renaming or deleting if other projects are using them. The profiles
are shared by all projects, so if you delete or rename one that was
being used by another project, that project will no longer be able to
use its profile (*** it might be best to make profiles unique to projects?)
A new profile can be created by copying (probably renaming) and editing
an existing one. A special directory browser dialog makes it easy to
do this - you can select the profile directory you want to copy and
enter the new name in the same dialog.
</p>

<p>All profile information is kept in the correspondingly named directory
within the directory '~/.config/larch/working_dir/MyProfiles'.
</p>

<h3>Processor architecture</h3>
<p>I think it should be possible to build an i686 system while running an
x86_64 one, but I haven't tried this, so it probably won't work!

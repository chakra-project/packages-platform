<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Using the GUI</h2>

<p><em>larch-7</em> is (in contrast to previous versions) designed to be
run from a graphical user interface. It is possible to use it from the
command line, but this should really only be done when scripting builds -
the command line provides just a subset of the operations available in the
GUI, in a much less comfortable form.
</p>

<p>The <em>larch</em> documentation is available in the GUI, and there are
documentation pages for each of the tabs in the <em>larch</em> window.

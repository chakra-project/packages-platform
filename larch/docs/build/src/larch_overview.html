<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Overview of the <em>larch</em> build system</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><em>Before we get started I should point out that <em>larch</em> must
gain root privileges in order to do its work (though it is advisable to
start it as a non-privileged user), and that much of this work consists
of deleting and overwriting files and even complete directories. If just
one of these is wrong it might make quite a mess of your system. That is
quite normal for an installer, but you will be using it on a system that
is already configured and this is somewhat risky - if you set up your
configuration wrong (or if you or I made some other mistake ...), you
might find you have destroyed some important data and/or your system
doesn't work any more. But that's life - <strong>Share and
Enjoy!</strong></em>

<h3><a name="larch_installation"></a>Installation of the <em>larch</em> build
system</h3>

<p>The <em>larch</em> package may be installed in the normal
<em>Arch Linux</em> way using <em>pacman</em>. This method will only work on
an <em>Arch</em> system, of course. The <em>larch</em> repository can be
found at <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/larch/larch7/i686/"><strong>berlios</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>larch</em> may be used without installing it.
This should also work on non-<em>Arch Linux</em> systems. See
 <a href="larch_quick.html">Quick Start</a> for details.
</p>

<p>If you are not running <em>Arch Linux</em>, you will need to download
the 'pacman-allin' package from the <em>larch</em> repository and unpack this
to the same location as you unpack the 'larch' package to. This provides
a pacman executable together with all the libraries it needs, the
'repo-add' script, and a 'mirrorlist' file. If you used the 'larch-setup'
script to download <em>larch</em>, you should find that this was done
automatically.
</p>

<p>Normally <em>larch</em> should be started as a normal user. Don't start
it as root unless you have some good reason for doing so - when it needs the
root password it will ask you for it.
</p>

<h3><a name="larch_projects"></a>Projects and Profiles</h3>

<p>A <em>larch</em> 'project' simply gathers together a few configuration options
concerning the build environment. Examples are the location of the installation,
pacman options, such as package repository locations, which profile to build
with, which boot loader to use, and so on. These are all options which don't
directly affect the design of the <em>live</em> system to be built. Most of the
remaining configuration options do concern the design and are specified in the
'profile'.
</p>

<p>A <em>larch</em> 'profile' contains the information needed to build a
particular flavour of <em>Arch Linux</em> - which packages to install, and
how it should be set up.
</p>

<p>For further details see <a href="gui_project_settings.html">GUI Tab:
Project Settings</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="larch_install"></a>System Installation overview</h3>

<p>The <em>larch live</em> system will normally be built from a fresh
(unmodified, unconfigured) <em>Arch</em> installation. The Installation stage
handles the creation of this installation by downloading all the desired packages
(if they are not already in the host's package cache) and installing them to the
directory set by the project (the default is /home/larchbuild).
</p>

<p>By default the package cache on the build host will be used, so that only
packages which have not already been downloaded will be fetched from the
chosen mirror. But it is possible to select another cache location, which
can also be on a remote machine, mounted using <em>sshfs</em> or <em>NFS</em>.
</p>

<p>See <a href="gui_installation.html">GUI Tab: Installation</a> for
further details.
</p>

<p>This raw installation will not normally be modified by <em>larch</em>,
so it can be reused, or even carefully experimented with. However, note
that any changes you make to this installation manually will not be
reflected in the profile, so it might be difficult to reproduce what you
have done at a later time, or to revert the changes.
***+ Would it be useful to incorporate changes made via the Tweaks page into the
profile? Offer it as an option? -***
If you want to configure your system, then the raw installation is probably
not the best place for it, consider rather using the 'rootoverlay' directory
in the profile. All files in this directory will 'overwrite' (well, 'overlay',
actually) corresponding files in the base installation, by placing them
in a higher layer in the <em>aufs</em> mount in the <em>live</em> system.
This makes it very easy to collect your own customizations in a way that
can be applied quickly to a future build.
</p>

<h3><a name="running_larchify"></a>Quick <em>larchify</em> overview</h3>

<p>Once we have an <em>Arch Linux</em> installation and have specified our
customizations in the profile, we can combine all this information into two
squashfs archives and an <em>initramfs</em> (to allow the <em>live</em> system
to boot). I call this step 'larchification'. The lowest layer in the <em>aufs</em>
mount is the raw installation, which is compressed into a <em>squashfs</em>
archive, 'system.sqf'. All the modifications specified in the profile, as well, as some
common to all  <em>larch</em> systems are in the archive 'mods.sqf', which
'overlays' the basic installation.
</p>

<p>In order to aid experimentation with profile tweaks which do not affect the
underlying installation, it is possible to repeat the 'larchify' step without rebuilding
the 'system.sqf' archive, which saves quite a bit of time.
</p>

<h3><a name="buildmedium"></a>Building a bootable medium</h3>

<p>When the 'larchification' has been completed, we can choose how to configure
the device onto which our <em>live</em> system is to be installed. Most of the
options on the 'Medium' page should be fairly self explanatory. We have a choice
of media (iso, for CD/DVD, or partitions in general, be they USB-sticks, hard disks
or whatever). It is also possible to select a bootloader and tweak its configuration.
</p>

<p>When the <em>live</em> system is installed to a partition (e.g. USB-stick) it is
possible to choose how the boot partition will be recognized. So long as
<em>larch</em> also installs a bootloader it can also add the appropriate entries
to the bootloader configuration file automatically. The options available are via UUID,
partition label, partition name (e.g. '/dev/sdb1'), or by searching for a partition
containing the file 'larch/larchboot'. See also
<a href="larch_running.html#bootparm">'Boot parameters'</a>.
</p>

<p>It is possible to repeat the installation onto various media, changing the
configuration, without needing to rerun the 'larchification' step. The constituent
<em>larch</em> files remain unchanged.
</p>

<h3><a name="usb2bootiso"></a>Building a boot CD for a USB-stick</h3>

<p>Older computers may not be able to boot from USB devices, so the possibility
of generating a small <em>boot iso</em> is provided. This can be burned to CD
and can be used to boot your <em>larch</em> system on a USB-stick. As this
function uses the system on the USB-stick, this needs to be plugged in (not
mounted!) and selected in the 'Partition' entry.
</p>

<h3><a name="Minimal_build_system_requirements"></a>Minimal build system requirements</h3>

<p><em>larch</em> has been designed to work without extensive demands on the
build system. The main requirement is pyqt for the gui (I am not sure what
the oldest working version is, but 4.4 should be safe) and python's pexpect
module (<em>Arch</em> package 'python-pexpect'). Although it has been
developed under <em>Arch Linux</em>, <em>larch</em> should run on other
<em>GNU/Linux</em> systems. By means of a sort of bootstrapping, the required
software has been kept to a minimum - many of the build functions are carried
out on the newly installed <em>Arch</em> system using <em>chroot</em>.
For example, you do not need support for <em>squashfs</em> or <em>aufs</em> on
the build system. But <em>bash</em>, <em>mkfs.vfat</em>, <em>mkfs.ext2</em>,
<em>blkid</em> and <em>sfdisk</em>
***+ ... -*** are assumed to be available (on <em>Arch</em> that is packages
'bash', 'dosfstools', 'e2fsprogs' and 'util-linux-ng').
</p>

<h3><a name="pacman_conf"></a>'pacman.conf' and 'mirrorlist'</h3>

<p>The GUI offers easy adjustment of the pacman.conf and mirror used for
installing the <em>Arch</em> system to be converted into a <em>live</em>
system. A customized 'mirrorlist' file can be used just for the
installation, but there is also a special feature in <em>larch-7</em> to
ease the use of a local package mirror (again, just for the installation).
The supplied path need not even be a complete mirror. During development
work I have indeed used a 'dummy' mirror containing only the appropriate
****.db.tar.gz files, relying on all the packages being taken from the
host's cache. (The script 'repos.sh' supplied with <em>larch</em> in the
'scripts' directory can build these 'db' files from the current state of
the pacman sync database on the host.)
</p>

<h3><a name="Squashfs_and_Unionfs"></a>squashfs and aufs</h3>

<p>The system to be <em>larchified</em> is made into a <em>squashed</em>
file-system in the file <strong>system.sqf</strong>. This is mounted as the
lower layer of a <em>union</em> (<em>aufs</em>) file-system. On top of that
there is a writeable <em>tmpfs</em> layer so that the file-system as a whole
appears writeable. An (initially empty, or rather non-existent) 'overlay' archive
is copied into the writeable layer. As this top layer is compressed using
<em>lzop</em>, the 'lzop' package must be installed in the target.
Of course only the <em>tmpfs</em> top layer can actually be written to,
and its contents disappear when the system reboots, so the writing is only
temporary. This can be overcome to some extent by using the session-saving
features described below.
</p>

<p>There is also a second overlay archive, a squashed file system (mods.sqf),
which appears as a middle layer in the union file-system. This initially
contains all the modifications to the base system needed to convert that
into a <em>larch</em> system as well as all the changes specified in the
profile. Using the merge-overlay feature it is possible to rebuild this
archive to incorporate subsequent changes to the system.
</p>

<p>A third overlay archive will also appear if the merge-overlay feature
is used. This is also a squashfs archive and lies between the bottom layer
(system.sqf) and the modifications layer (mods.sqf). It contains only
'whiteout' files, to mask files in the base system which have later been
deleted.
</p>

<p>In order to boot into a system constructed in that manner, you need an
<em>initramfs</em> which deals with mounting all the various bits in the right
way before entering the normal boot sequence. In <em>larch</em> the
<em>initramfs</em> is built using the standard <em>Arch</em> 'mkinitcpio'
system, for which special 'hooks' (essentially code plug-ins) have been
developed to manage the requirements of a <em>larch live</em> system.
</p>

<h3><a name="aufs"></a>unionfs as an alternative to aufs</h3>

<p>***+ In principle, <em>unionfs</em> can be used instead of <em>aufs</em>,
but as <em>aufs</em> is supported by current <em>Arch Linux</em> kernels
it is obviously the first choice. Indeed the current <em>larch</em> code
probably won't work with <em>unionfs</em>, as it hasn't been tested - but
the framework to support it is in place. -***
</p>

<h3><a name="Custom_packages"></a>Custom packages</h3>

<p>It is possible to include your own 'custom' packages in the installation.
Maybe ones you have compiled yourself, e.g. from the AUR, or modified versions
(fixes or customizations) of standard packages. To do this you need to put your
packages in a directory and run <strong>gen-repo</strong>
on this directory (run it without arguments to get usage instructions). Then place
an entry for this new repository in your 'pacman.conf' (use the button on
the 'Installation' page to edit your pacman.conf repositories).
If your packages replace some in the existing repositories, your custom
repository needs to come before those repositories in 'pacman.conf'.
Any packages you want installed now just need to be
listed in <strong>addedpacks</strong>.
</p>

<p>It is not necessary to build a custom kernel for <em>larch</em>, the
standard kernel ('kernel26') can be used. It includes the <em>squashfs</em>
module and is included in the set of 'base' packages. <em>aufs</em> is
available in the package 'aufs2'.
</p>

<h3><a name="Generating_the_basepacks_list"></a>Generating
the base package list</h3>

<p>In case the base package set changes, the list
provided by 'pacman -Sg base' is used. However, it is possible to filter
out certain unwanted packages from the base set, by placing the unwanted
package names in the 'vetopacks' file in the profile (one package per line).
In most cases the default setting (empty) will be satisfactory, but if you
do change it, be aware that vetoed packages will be installed anyway if
they are required by some other installed package.
</p>

<h3><a name="addedpacks"></a><em>addedpacks</em></h3>

<p>This group of packages is the main place for defining your system.
Here you can enter all the applications you would like in your live CD/USB system
(and subsequently installed to a hard disk partition, if that was your intention).
Thanks to <em>pacman</em> you don't need to sort out dependencies,
these should all be included automatically.
</p>

<p>In order to support building a <em>larch</em> system, certain packages outside
the <em>Arch</em> base group must be installed in the system to be 'larchified'
(the <em>larch</em> installer includes the first group automatically):

<pre style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>squashfs-tools</em>, <em>lzop</em>, <em>larch-live</em>,

<em>aufs2</em>, <em>aufs2-util</em> (unless using the untested <em>unionfs</em> these <strong>must</strong>
                be present),

<em>syslinux</em> (if using isolinux or syslinux),
<em>cdrkit</em> (for building an iso),
<em>eject</em> (to eject a CD at shutdown).

For the hard-disk installer - <em>larchin</em>, <em>python</em>, <em>pyqt</em>,
<em>parted</em>, <em>ntfsprogs</em>,
(optional, but recommended) <em>gparted</em> or <em>partitionmanager</em>.

For this documentation, and for the capability of making further
<em>live</em> media - <em>larch</em>.
</pre>
</p>

<h3><a name="existingSystem"></a>Making a live CD from an existing <em>Arch</em>
installation</h3>

<p>By setting the installation path to an existing <em>Arch</em> installation,
a <em>live</em> medium can be made from it, by skipping to the larchify page.
The installation must already be mounted, including any sub-mounts
(e.g. /home on another partition). The main mount must be with
options 'exec,dev', because most of the building is done via a <em>chroot</em>
to the installation. This approach to <em>live</em> system generation is probably
not a good idea if the installation contains a lot of data - consider how big the
result will be ...
</p>

<p>Also the currently running (<em>Arch</em> only!) system can be
<em>larchified</em>, by setting the installation path to '/'.
This is, however, not recommended. Building from a running system can easily
result in data corruption because the file-system might well change during
the build process.
</p>

<p>Note that some things in '/var' will not be included in the 'live' system.
Firstly, the standard <em>pacman</em> package cache, '/var/cache/pacman/pkg'.
Also the log files (in '/var/log') and '/var/tmp' (temporary files, like '/tmp')
are not saved. As some files in '/var/log' are required for certain aspects of
logging to function, these are recreated in the <em>initramfs</em>.
</p>
